## Project Guide: Simple AI Chatbot **Gyan** with a React Frontend

**Goal:** To build a web-based chat application where users can send messages to an Artificial Intelligence (AI) language model and receive responses, displayed in a conversational interface. This AI assistant, **Gyan**, is designed as an entry point for learning React, basic AI agent interaction, and understanding the foundational concepts relevant to Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**Learning Objectives:**

- **React Fundamentals:** Gain hands-on experience with setting up React projects, building user interfaces using components, managing application state, handling user input, and applying basic styling.
- **AI Agent Development (Basic):** Learn how to integrate a frontend application with external Large Language Model (LLM) APIs, manage asynchronous data requests, and understand the basic flow of sending user queries to an AI and processing its responses for **Gyan**.
